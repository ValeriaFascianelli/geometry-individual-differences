## NeuralGeometry-BehavioralDiffs


This repository contains 4 main directories with python scripts and datasets. Each of them aims to reproduce the main behavioral and neural analyses from real and artificial datasets.  

1. "behavior" directory: it contains the 'behavior_main.py' and the behavioral data from 2 subjects. To reproduce the main behavioral figures, run the main script. It will upload the behavioral data and run all the main analyses (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure 2).

2. "behavior_RNN": it contains the "behavioral_model_rnn.py" and all the behavioral data from RNNs to reproduce the behavioral results of the models (Figure 7-8).

3. "neural data": it contains "compute_decoding_ccgp.py" and the neural data of the 2 subjects. It will run the decoding and ccgp analysis on the actual dataset (Figures 3-4). 

4. "neural RNN": it contains "decoding_ccgp_RNNs.py" and the RNN units activity to reproduce the the main RNN results(figure 7-8).
